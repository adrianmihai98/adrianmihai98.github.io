        <p>Application Support Engineer L1, IDEMIA
        Bucharest | May 2023 - present<br></br>
        Having amassed one year of experience as an Application Support Engineer, I have cultivated a robust set of skills in troubleshooting and optimizing systems. My expertise extends to command-line Unix tools, where I excel in investigating infrastructure issues, analyzing file systems, and interpreting logs. Alongside my proficiency in Atlassian tools such as Jira, Confluence, and Bitbucket, I bring hands-on experience with RDP (Remote Desktop Protocol) and Windows Servers.

Moreover, my knowledge encompasses vSphere, allowing me to effectively manage virtualized environments and ensure the efficiency and reliability of critical systems. In the realm of application support, I possess a strong understanding of Kubernetes, enabling me to navigate and optimize containerized environments. My skills also extend to interpreting logs and troubleshooting issues within a Linux environment.

A significant aspect of my expertise lies in monitoring systems using Grafana, Zabbix, and Centreon. I have acquired in-depth knowledge of these tools, where I have not only implemented monitoring solutions but also developed the ability to analyze graphical representations.

Adept at managing shared folders and possessing basic networking knowledge, I troubleshoot and maintain network connectivity with ease. I am proficient in identifying processes linked to specific applications, scheduling tasks using cron jobs, and checking network interfaces and opened ports. My skill set also includes a solid understanding of SQL.

In terms of responsibilities, my role involves independent analysis and implementation of workarounds, providing technical expertise on Idemia products. I collaborate seamlessly with the support team to prioritize customer needs while maintaining trust. Actively sharing knowledge within the organization, I identify and resolve key issues and risks. My focus is on delivering consistent, reliable, and high-quality outcomes, proactively analyzing recurrent incidents, designing long-term solutions, and participating in testing and installing bug fixes and patches. </p>
